        <h2> Hello! </h2>
        
        <p> <!-- I am making this paragraph an introduction paragraph telling my name, age, school, family, hometown, etc. --> My name is Ruth Wilhelm. I am 16 years old and attend Padua Academy in Wilmington, Delaware. I live in Middletown with my parents and the love of my life, my chocolate lab named Billy Boy. I have a sister named Sara-Beth who is 14 years older than me. She is married to my brother-in-law, Cameron, and has two daughters, my neices, Reilly and Brianne. My family is really close and we love to travel, shop, and bake together! </p>
        
        <p> <!-- This paragraph talks about my involvement in theater along with my sister's involvement in dance. --> My sister, my neices, and I all <b>love</b> theater! My sister is a dance teacher at MOT Charter High School while I participate in Padua Theater productions and along with shows at The Everett Theater in Middletown. We love to blast "Rent" and "Legally Blonde" during car rides. </p>
